# JB-MoveOrigin
An add-on for Blender that makes it easy to move the origin of the selected object to the currently selected vertex/vertices, edge(s) or face(s).

The action is added to the bottom of the right-click menu shown in the 3D Viewport when editing the object.

Currently, if multiple objects are selected, origin will be moved to the currently active object. I may change this later.
